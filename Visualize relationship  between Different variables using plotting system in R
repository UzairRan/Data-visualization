###Visualize relationship  between Different variables using plotting system in R
##1. Using the state.x77 and state.region datasets, visualize the relationship between Income and illiteracy.
data <- state
df  <- data.frame(state.x77)
df$region <- state.region
plot(df$Income ~ df$Illiteracy, data = df, col = df$region, pch = 19,
     xlab = "Illiteracy",  ylab = "Income", main = "Income vs Illiteracy")

##2. Visualize the relationship between Population, region and life expectancy (Life.Exp)
library(ggplot2)
data(state.x77)
data(state)
state$region <- state.region
state$region <- as.factor(state$region)
ggplot(state, aes(x=Population, y=Life.Exp)) + geom_point(aes(color=region)) + labs(title="Relationship between Population, Region and Life Expectancy", x="Population", y="Life Expectancy")


##3. Export the charts to a pdf file.
pdf("charts.pdf")
ggplot(state, aes(x = "Income", y = "Illiteracy")) + geom_point(aes(color= region)) + labs(title= "Relationship between Income and Illiteracy", x = "Income", y = "Illiteracy")
ggplot(state, aes(x = "Population", y = "Life.Exp")) + geom_point(aes(color= region)) + labs(title = "Relationship between Population, Region and Life Expectancy", x = "Population", y="Life Expectancy")
dev.off()

### 1. Using the visualize the relationship between height and weight from the women dataset.
##3 Women dataset
dataset(women)
library(lattice)
xyplot(height ~ weight, data = women)
##2. Is there a strong correlation between the two quantities? Compute correlation coefficient and fit a linear regression model
with(women, plot(height, weight, main = "height and weight"))
model <- lm(height ~ weight, women)
abline(model, lwd = 2, col = "red", lty = 5)
##3. Export the charts and results to a pdf file.
pdf("charts.pdf")

###1. Using the longley dataset, plot the relationship between Umployed and GNP.
## longley dataset
head(longley)
library(ggplot2)
qplot(Unemployed, GNP, data = longley)
##2. As a scatter plot, plot out Unemployed values as blue dots and Employed values as green dots. 
qplot(Unemployed, GNP, data = longley, Unemployed = "blue", Employed = "Green")
