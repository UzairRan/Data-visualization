# Data-visualization
In this project I use plotting Systemk in R to Visualize The Relationship between variables

1. Using the state.x77 and state.region datasets, visualize the relationship between Income and illiteracy.
2. Visualize the relationship between Population, region and life expectancy (Life.Exp)
3. Export the charts to a pdf file.
